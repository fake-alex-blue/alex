# Alex Blue - Personal Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal website, which is hosted on GitHub Pages.

### About

This site was created as part of my application to [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/) software development bootcamp. 

It's a very simple 'about me' website. 

It tries to show off a few of the things I've learned recently, while also providing a bit of information about why I want to be a developer.


### Technologies Used

-    **HTML**
-    **CSS**
-    **JavaScript** (in particular, IntersectionObserver is doing some heavy lifting)


### Design Philosophy

In designing this site I wanted something that was visually striking and which uses very few words to get its message across.

The interactive on-scroll animation helps to drive engagement with the text.

### Limitations

- **Accessibililty** Although not completely asemantic in its design, the site doesn't make the most of modern accessibility options. And it certainly isn't currently suitable for users who prefer reduced motion.
- **Responsiveness** The site was designed to centre the experience of a visitor viewing it on a fullscreen 1920x1080 landscape monitor. It wasn't built with responsive design principles in mind, but going forwards I'd look to refactor it to be suitable for smaller screens and mobile devices.
